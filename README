This application should allow users to easily handle their accounts, including cash flows and predicted spending and incomes.

Here are some features I would like to implement this week:

- Use SQLite to store data
- Fetch currencies values

Here are the features for later:

- Enter and edit data monthly
- Support multi-currencies
- Tricount offline
- Connect to server
- Tricount with other users
